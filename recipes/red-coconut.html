<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 medium white onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 medium red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
    <li>½ medium jalapeno pepper, minced</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons red curry paste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno and cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer veggies to a bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and add coconut milk, curry paste, brown sugar, and fish sauce to the pan. Whisk together and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
    <li>Combine cornstarch and water in a small bowl; whisk to dissolve. Add to sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pat shrimp dry and add to the sauce along with the cooked veggies. Allow curry to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are cooked through and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Top with Thai basil and serve with lime wedges.</li>
