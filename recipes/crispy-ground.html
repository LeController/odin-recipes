<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>¼ cup Mexican crema</li>
    <li>2 limes</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
    <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place red onion slices and crema in separate small bowls. Zest limes into another small bowl. Halve limes and squeeze juice into a fourth small bowl.</li>
    <li>Stir 1 teaspoon lime juice into the bowl of crema. Add the remaining lime juice to the bowl with the red onions; stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and let marinate at room temperature until pickled, at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chayote and poblano pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until golden and tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Coat tortillas on both sides with cooking spray. Place tortillas on a large baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crisped and lightly brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir the lime zest, 1/2 the cilantro, onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the chayote-poblano mixture. Pour mixture into a bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add ground turkey; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup water, taco seasoning, and chili powder. Cook until water has evaporated, about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Spread guacamole over each crisped tortilla; top with chayote-poblano mixture, ground turkey, pickled onions, lime crema, and remaining cilantro.</li>
